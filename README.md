## Overview
This project is a **React Native job search app** that allows users to browse and view job listings from a public API.  
It was built as a hands-on learning project to understand how React Native works — including components, navigation, and API integration — while following a YouTube tutorial as a guide.

The app demonstrates how to fetch live data, handle asynchronous calls, and design clean mobile UI layouts using React Native and Expo.

## Inspiration
I started this project to **learn React Native** and get comfortable with the workflow of building mobile apps using JavaScript.  
Following a tutorial helped me understand core concepts like component structure, props, hooks, navigation, and state management.  
The job listing theme provided a simple yet meaningful context to practice **data fetching, dynamic rendering, and styling** — all essential skills for mobile development.
